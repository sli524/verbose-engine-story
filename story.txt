There once lived a little vampire named Rose. She was unaware of her difference from other kids because she
was well protected by her vampire dad Luke. Ever since Rose was born, she has never left their house or been
outside. As Rose grew older, Rose became more and more curious to the outside world.

But Rose's parent knew the danger of the outside world. The fact that there are a lot of violence and suffering
in this world made the parents to protect their child as best as possible. But Rose did not listen. Rose went
outside and started driving down the street. Then Rose was pulled over right away because Rose was driving 
without a license. Harsh world. 

As the police officer approached the car, Rose opened the door and started to run. The officer chased after
her yelling for her to stop, but she would not listen. Rose quickly ran out of breath and the officer caught
up to her.

Rose was terrified, expecting the worse to come. However, it was Rose's lucky
day. As soon as the police officer took one look at her pale face and caught
a glimpse of her fangs, he told Rose to forget anything ever happened, and ran
away from her as fast as he could. It was a close call, but Rose ended up safe
and learned the dangers of the real world.
