There once lived a little vampire named Rose. She was unaware of her difference from other kids because she
was well protected by her vampire dad Luke. Ever since Rose was born, she has never left their house or been
outside. As Rose grew older, Rose became more and more curious to the outside world.

But Rose's parent knew the danger of the outside world. The fact that there are a lot of violence and suffering in this world made the parents to protect their child as best as possible. But Rose did not listen. Rose went outside and started driving down the street. Then Rose was pulled over right away because Rose was driving without a license. Harsh world.
